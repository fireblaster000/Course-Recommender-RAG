# LUMS Course Assistant üéì

_A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for academic course selection assistance at LUMS_

![Project Banner](assets\RAG_Poster.png)

## üìå Project Overview

The LUMS Course Assistant is an advanced AI system designed to help students at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) make informed course selection decisions. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the system provides personalized recommendations based on historical course reviews and official course outlines.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Course Recommendations**: Get personalized suggestions based on your academic level and interests
- **Detailed Reviews**: Access comprehensive student reviews about difficulty, workload, and teaching quality
- **Semester Planning**: Discover which courses are typically offered in specific semesters
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language interaction with our AI assistant
- **Course Outlines**: Official component breakdowns, prerequisites, and study resources
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Maintains conversation context for follow-up questions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Data Collection

- 471 student reviews from Google Forms and LUMS Discussion Forum
- 170 course outlines from LUMS Registrar Portal
- Manually annotated metadata (course abbreviations, aliases, offering semesters)

### Technology Stack

| Component            | Technology Used                     | Key Benefits                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Embeddings           | OllamaEmbeddings (nomic-embed-text) | State-of-the-art retrieval         |
| Vector Database      | Chroma DB                           | Open source, high performance      |
| Large Language Model | Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2            | 7B parameters, instruct fine-tuned |
| Framework            | LangChain                           | Modular design, RAG optimized      |
| Interface            | Gradio + ngrok                      | User-friendly, web accessible      |

### System Architecture

1. **Document Loading**:
   - `Docx2txtLoader` for text documents
   - `PyPDFLoader` for course outlines
2. **Vector Storage**: Chroma DB with nomic-embed-text embeddings
3. **Retrieval**: Similarity-based document retrieval
4. **Generation**: Mistral-7B-Instruct with custom prompt engineering
5. **Memory**: `ConversationBufferMemory` (K=3 interactions)
